    <h1>Terrorism Legislation</h1>
    <h2>the terrorism legislation is a piece of law that can be used to prosecute any terrorist actions, these are defined by these following rules:</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
    <ul>
        <li class="important">action designed to seriously interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system</li>
        <li>serious violence against a person</li>
        <li>serious damage to property</li>
        <li>endangering a person's life </li>
        <li>creating a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public</li>
      </ul>
    <p>most of these are not useful to computer science besides the <dfn><abbr title="action designed to seriously interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system">first in the list</abbr></dfn></p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box3">
        <p>The terrorism legislation doesn't come up that often in the exams as it usually isn't that applicable however
            it has some massive implications as if it is applicable it carries massive jail-time for things that you 
            may not even know the average sentance being roughly 5 years but can massively change over small details</p>
        <p>This section deals with situations where someone tries to mess with computer systems or networks in a 
            serious way. This could involve hacking into systems, spreading viruses, doing things to disrupt 
            how computers work or facilitating terrorism by sharing bomb making instuctions for example </p>
        <p>it should also be noted that S1BE of the act about computers has been heviliy critisized and are
            generally considered outside the scope of terrorism however the government still enforces this occasionally</p>

        <h4>all of this is a bit confusing though so lets try to clear it up with some examples</h4>
        <p onclick="display(1);"><strong>Example 1:</strong> Po discovers many vulnrebilities in a
        the governments system and reports them to the authorities? </p><p id="a"></p>
        <p onclick="display(2);""><strong>Example 2:</strong> Tinky Winky is analyzing online activities to monitor
